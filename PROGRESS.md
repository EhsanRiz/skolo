# Skolo — Development Progress
*Last updated: 8 May 2026*

> **Pick-up checklist after switching machines:**
> 1. `git pull origin main`
> 2. `cd backend && npm install` and same in `frontend/` and `parent-app/`
> 3. Make sure each `.env` is populated (see env vars below)
> 4. Last shipped commit: `d5f2895` — Modern Academic palette + light auth pages

## Tech Stack

- **Staff frontend:** React/Vite PWA → `frontend/` → Cloudflare Pages
- **Parent frontend:** React/Vite PWA → `parent-app/` → Cloudflare Pages (separate project)
- **Backend:** Express.js → `backend/` → Render
- **DB:** Supabase PostgreSQL with RLS (multi-tenant by `school_id`); backend bypasses RLS via service role key
- **Auth:** JWT, 7-day expiry. localStorage keys: `sk_token` (staff), `sk_parent_token` (parent), `sk_user` (user JSON)
- **Email:** Resend, verified domain `4dcs.co.za`
- **PDF:** pdfkit (report cards)
- **Fonts:** Inter via Google Fonts
- **No external UI library** — inline styles + a design-token object `t` in `frontend/src/components/ui.jsx`

## Modern Academic Design System

*Established 8 May 2026, applied across staff + parent + landing.*

| Role | Color | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Navy | `#003049` | Primary CTAs, headings, sidebar, brand anchor |
| Navy hover | `#00253a` | Primary button hover |
| Soft Gray | `#f7f7f7` | Page background |
| Sky Blue | `#669bbc` | Secondary accents, active states, info |
| Sky Blue tint | `#e6eff5` | Backgrounds, hovers, secondary buttons |
| Amber | `#f7c548` | **Urgent attention only** — overdue, pending, marketing CTAs |
| Amber tint | `#fef4d6` | Subtle attention surfaces |
| Amber dark | `#b8870a` | Amber text |
| Success | `#16a34a` (`#dcfce7` tint) | Paid/positive states |
| Danger | `#dc2626` (`#fee2e2` tint) | Errors/overdue |
| Border | `#e5e7eb` | Subtle dividers |
| Text | `#1f2937` (primary), `#6b7280` (muted), `#9ca3af` (faint), `#374151` (label) | — |
| Special | `#7c3aed` purple | Reserved for: waived fees, SuperAdmin tier, unread notifications, timetable subjects (semantic differentiation only — not a brand color) |

**Rules:**
- Amber is the only warm color in a cool-toned palette — use it sparingly so it stays as the "attention magnet."
- Sky Blue plays the supporting role to Navy (sidebar active states, info pills, hover tints, chevrons).
- Marketing landing-page CTAs may use Amber for conversion despite the "urgency only" rule.
- Primary action buttons in the app are Navy.

The token system lives at `frontend/src/components/ui.jsx` (the `t` object). Most pages bypass it and use hardcoded hex codes — the colors above were applied via a sweep across 1,755 hex references in 42 files. New code should reference `t.primary`, `t.accent`, `t.attention` etc. rather than hardcoding hex.

---

## Recent Sessions

### 8 May 2026 — Visual polish sweep (post-palette audit)

- **Landing page palette consistency:** swept three off-palette tints (`#fef3c7` → `#fef4d6` amber tint, `#d97706` → `#b8870a` amber dark, `#f0f5fa` → `#e6eff5` Sky Blue tint); decorative purple → Sky Blue on the Audience "Education organisations" globe icon and the Challenges "Real-time visibility" stat. Skolo AI plan tier and Exam grades feature icon keep their purple (justified per palette spec — tier semantic and subject/grades semantic).
- **Sidebar active state → Sky Blue:** `Layout.jsx` `.nav-link.active` background changed from translucent white to `#669bbc` per the Modern Academic mockup spec; notification panel's "general" item bg also fixed to `#e6eff5`.
- **LearnerProfile upgrade CTA:** premium-gate copy now reads "Contact **InnovaEarth** or **4D Climate Solutions** to upgrade…" — both linkable, matches footer attribution.
- **Parent dashboard Outstanding stat:** color changed from danger red `#dc2626` to amber dark `#b8870a` so an outstanding balance reads as "attention-needed" (amber) rather than "error" (red), matching the hero mockup on the landing page.

### 8 May 2026 — Modern Academic palette migration (3 commits)

- `0288ea9` — token system rebuilt around semantic roles (`primary`, `accent`, `attention`, `success`, `danger`); 1,482 hardcoded hex codes swept across 42 files; embedded JPEG 4DCS logos removed from Login/Register; footer attribution everywhere updated to "Developed by [InnovaEarth](https://innovaearth.com) in collaboration with [4D Climate Solutions](https://4dcs.co.za)" with both names clickable
- `b649e54` — landing page hero rebuilt: dark Navy gradient → light Soft-Gray-to-Sky-Blue; new copy "Less admin. More learning."; mockup card became white with mini KPIs (Outstanding in Amber); hero stats row added (12 schools / 3,400+ learners / 2 countries); navbar went white-with-Navy-text; "Request a Demo" hero CTA → Amber
- `d5f2895` — fixes from live review: navbar logo split into icon + wordmark for clean white nav; AI-Powered section → light theme; bottom CTA Demo button green → Amber; Login + Register pages → light Soft-Gray-to-Sky-Blue background with subtle navy equation overlay (was dark Navy with white chalk); SVG logos updated to new Navy/Sky Blue colors

### 13 April 2026 — Attendance + role-based access
- Attendance audit trail, learner filters, fees tab fix, principal fees dashboard (`2298106`)
- Role-based attendance — read-only for admin/principal with edit override (`138da7a`)

## Environment Variables

### Backend (Render — `.env`)
```
SUPABASE_URL=https://sxhjsmajoetvdgrpuawa.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=<service-role-key>
JWT_SECRET=<jwt-secret>
PORT=3001
FRONTEND_URL=https://myskolo.co.za
RESEND_API_KEY=<resend-api-key>
```

### Staff frontend (Cloudflare Pages — `.env`)
```
VITE_API_URL=https://skolo-api.onrender.com
```

### Parent app (Cloudflare Pages — `.env`)
```
VITE_API_URL=https://skolo-api.onrender.com
```

---

## Key Business Logic

### Fee auto-generation
- Runs on Fees page load, learner enrolment, and learner profile fees tab
- `POST /fee-ledger/auto-generate` is idempotent
- Dedup is **month-level** (`YYYY-MM`), not date-level
- Status computed live: due_date vs today, payments vs amount_due

### Waiver workflow
1. Bursar requests waiver (with reason + optional note) → email to principal + bell notification
2. Principal approves/rejects from Waivers page → email to bursar + bell notification
3. On approve, fee_ledger updated with `amount_waived`, `waiver_reason`, `waived_by`

### Parent portal vs Parent app
- **Portal (legacy):** `/parent/:token` on staff frontend, no login, hex token URL, read-only fee summary
- **App (new):** separate PWA at parent.myskolo.co.za, `parent` role on users table linked via `guardian_id`, full features (fees, attendance, grades, messages, events)

### Internal messaging
- Tables: `conversations` + `conversation_participants` + `messages`
- Types: direct (1:1 staff↔parent), class, grade, school-wide
- Polling: 5s for messages, 30s for unread count badge
- Supabase Realtime planned for Phase 2

### Custom grade scale
- Per-school in `schools.grade_boundaries` JSONB array `[{grade, min}]`
- Defaults to A/B/C/D/F if not configured
- Applies to exam grades, learner profile, report cards

### Attendance
- Unique constraint on `learner_id + date` — safe to re-submit register
- Audit table tracks edits (who, when, old → new)
- Principal/admin read-only with edit override

---

## Local Dev

```bash
# Backend (port 3001)
cd backend && npm install && npm run dev

# Staff frontend (port 5173)
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev

# Parent app (port 5174)
cd parent-app && npm install && npm run dev
```

Each requires its own `.env` populated.

---

## Deployment

```bash
git push origin main
```
- Cloudflare Pages auto-deploys both `frontend/` and `parent-app/` (verified working)
- Render auto-deploys `backend/` (✅ working as of `2298106`; was idle for the May palette commits since they didn't touch backend code)
- ~30-60 sec for Cloudflare, ~3-5 min for Render
- Render free tier spins down after inactivity, ~30s cold start on first request

If a deploy doesn't fire automatically, click **"Create deployment"** on Cloudflare Pages or **"Manual Deploy"** on Render.

## Still To Do

### Near-term
- [ ] **Bulk SMS for overdue fees** — Africa's Talking integration (needs AT account + credit)
- [ ] **Bank reconciliation** (paid feature) — upload bank statement, match by reference_no
- [ ] **Read receipts on announcements**
- [ ] **Attendance threshold alerts** — flag learners below e.g. 80%
- [ ] Consider replacing `#7c3aed` purple (waived/SuperAdmin/unread) with a Modern-Academic-aligned alternative

### Visual polish (post-palette)
- [x] Review remaining landing-page sections (Pain Points, Features, Audience, Pricing, Challenges, FAQ) — confirm they flow with the new lighter theme *(8 May)*
- [x] Check `LearnerProfile.jsx` "Contact 4D Climate Solutions to upgrade" body copy — now references both InnovaEarth and 4DCS *(8 May)*
- [x] Audit `Layout.jsx` sidebar against the mockup spec — Sky Blue active state applied *(8 May)*
- [x] Spot-check parent app dashboard against the mockup — Outstanding stat now amber *(8 May)*

### Phase 2
- [ ] Supabase Realtime for messaging (replace 5s polling)
- [ ] Attendance trends chart on Dashboard
- [ ] Bulk grade import from CSV
- [ ] Multi-language UI (Sesotho, Afrikaans)

### Phase 3
- [ ] Digital assignments
- [ ] AI homework assistant
- [ ] AI early warning alerts (the "Skolo AI" plan tier)
- [ ] Smart reports (natural language queries)
- [ ] Automated parent comms drafting

---

## Important Technical Notes

- Render free tier spins down after inactivity — first request ~30s delay
- `sk_token` = staff JWT in localStorage; `sk_parent_token` = parent JWT
- CORS allows `myskolo.co.za`, `parent.myskolo.co.za`, `*.skolo.pages.dev`, `*.myskolo.pages.dev`, localhost
- Supabase service role key bypasses RLS — all backend ops use this
- Logo: base64 data URL in `schools.logo_url` — no Storage bucket required
- Fee dedup is month-level, not date-level
- Invite tokens expire in 48 hours
- Password reset tokens expire in 1 hour (`crypto.randomBytes(32)`)
- Teacher records auto-created when role `teacher` user accepts invite
- Email FROM: `noreply@4dcs.co.za` (verified via Resend)
- Grade boundaries stored as JSONB array, sorted descending by min
- Cloudflare Pages `_redirects` file required in `public/` for SPA deep links
- `FRONTEND_URL` env on Render — fallback hardcoded to `https://myskolo.co.za`

## Onboarding a New School

1. Demo request via landing page → super-admin reviews → sends invite
2. Admin accepts invite at `/register?token=...` → creates school + admin account
3. Admin: Settings → Grades & Classes (R–12 + class letters)
4. Admin: Settings → Fee Plans (monthly/termly per grade)
5. Admin: Settings → Grade Scale (optional, defaults to A/B/C/D/F)
6. Admin: Learners → import CSV or add manually
7. Admin: Settings → Staff Accounts → invite teachers/bursar/principal
8. Teachers appear in Settings → Teachers automatically
9. Admin: assign classes to teachers (Settings → Teachers → + class)
10. Daily: teachers take attendance, bursars collect fees, principals approve waivers
11. Parent invites: Settings → Parent Accounts → email invite → parent sets password and downloads PWA
